This was from before we switched from CV2 to TensorFlow for Timmy’s neural network.

This is the current setup of Lil-Timmy, our self-driving RC car. The goal of this project was to create a self-driving RC that can successfully run though a paper track only using a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi camera to steer the car. Unlike some projects, Timmy was based around the idea of it being independent in its computation and be able to run without external help. Currently, Timmy requires a computer to start, but once running, is completely independent from the computer.
